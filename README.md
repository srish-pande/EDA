# Exploratory Data Analysis
Aim to this case study is to understand the driving factors behind a loan default and identifying such applicants using EDA. This would ensure that applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

**BUSSINESS OBJECTIVE :-**

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. 

When the _company receives_ a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision :
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

When a _client applies_ for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client/company :
- Approved: The Company has approved loan Application
- Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client, he received worse pricing which he did not want.
- Refused: The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).
- Unused offer:  Loan has been cancelled by the client but at different stages of the process.

We have used EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency to default.
